Task: Create a simple `RecyclerView.Adapter` that displays a list of user names and their ages. Each item should show the name and age side by side.

Input Format: You will be given an ArrayList of User objects. Each User object has two fields: a `String` representing the user’s name and an `int` representing their age.

Constraints:

The list will contain between 1 and 1000 users.
Each user’s name will be non-empty and will have at most 100 characters.
Age will be between 0 and 120.
Output Format: The adapter should bind the data such that each item in the `RecyclerView` displays a user’s name and age side by side.
